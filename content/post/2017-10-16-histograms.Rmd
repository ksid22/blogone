Another way to visualize data is a histogram. For our exapmle, we must first extract data from the Lahman package. To do this, we must load the following libraries.
```{r setup, include=(FALSE)}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)
```

Now we gather the approiate data using a sql request.
We want to find all the salaries of baseball players.

```{r}
query<-"SELECT salary FROM Salaries"
result<-sqldf(query)
```

Now we must visualize this data through a histogram.

```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(data=result,aes(x=salary),color="blue",bins=10)+
  ggtitle("Salary Distribution")+
  xlab('salary')+
  ylab('count')
```

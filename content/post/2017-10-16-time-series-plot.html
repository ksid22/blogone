<p>We must first begin with extrating data from Lahman and loading our other libraries.</p>
<p>We need to figure out Babe Ruthâ€™s homerun total for his career. Here is the sql request:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>query&lt;-&quot;SELECT yearID,HR FROM Batting
WHERE playerID=&#39;ruthba01&#39;&quot;
result&lt;-sqldf(query)</code></pre>
<p>Now we can take this data and put in in a time series plot so it easier to view.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR),size=1/2)+
  geom_line(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR))+
  ggtitle(&quot;Babe Ruth&#39;s Homeruns by Year&quot;)+
  xlab(&quot;Year&quot;)+
  ylab(&quot;Number of Homeruns&quot;)</code></pre>

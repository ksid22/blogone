We must first begin with extrating data from Lahman and loading our other libraries. 
```{r setup, include=(FALSE)}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)
```

We need to figure out Babe Ruth's homerun total for his career. Here is the sql request:
```{r}
query<-"SELECT yearID,HR FROM Batting
WHERE playerID='ruthba01'"
result<-sqldf(query)
```

Now we can take this data and put in in a time series plot so it easier to view. 

```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR),size=1/2)+
  geom_line(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR))+
  ggtitle("Babe Ruth's Homeruns by Year")+
  xlab("Year")+
  ylab("Number of Homeruns")

```
